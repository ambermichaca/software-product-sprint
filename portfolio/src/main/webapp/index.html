      <p>Welcome to my portfolio.</p>

      <p>My name is Amber Michaca. I am a rising junior at Barnard College,
          and I am studying computer science. My journey with CS started about 1.5 
          years ago, and since then I have been constantly learning new things. 
          I have experience working with various data structures such 
          as linkedLists and hashmaps. I enjoy front end development as well as 
          technical product managment which I was exposed to in my last internship
          at a telemedicine startup. My strongest languages are C and Java, however 
          I'm eager to gain more exposure to other languages.  
      </p>
      <p> Some projects I've worked on include: </p>
      <p> - Video Poker</p>
      <p> - Webpage downloader </p>
      <p> - Message database search program </p>
